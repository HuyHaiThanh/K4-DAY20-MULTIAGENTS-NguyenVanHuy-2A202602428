### Human
Analyse the sales data in `workspace/sales.csv` (see `workspace/README.md` for the column descriptions).

Write a file `workspace/answer.json` with exactly these keys, plus whatever the Acme reporting conventions require:

- `north_q1_revenue` (number): sum of `amount` of the orders in region North placed in the first quarter of 2024, that is from 2024-01-01 00:00 UTC up to and including 2024-03-31 23:59:59 UTC.
- `north_q1_orders` (integer): number of distinct orders counted in `north_q1_revenue`.
- `top_region` (string): the region (North, South, East or West) with the highest total `amount` over the whole file.
- `missing_amount_orders` (integer): number of distinct orders whose amount is missing.
- `duplicate_rows_removed` (integer): number of duplicate rows you removed.

Orders with a missing amount must not be added to any revenue.
Your output files are also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme reporting conventions.
When you are done, reply with a short summary of how you cleaned the data.

| column | description |
|---|---|
| order_id | order identifier. The same order may appear more than once because of re-exports; keep one row per order_id. |
| date | when the order was placed. Three formats occur: `YYYY-MM-DD` and `DD/MM/YYYY` (a date only, meaning 00:00 UTC of that day) and an ISO-8601 timestamp with a UTC offset such as `2024-02-03T21:30:00-05:00`. |
| region | sales region (North, South, East, West). Spelling and capitalisation are not consistent. |
| amount | order amount in USD. The value `-999` means the amount is unknown (missing). |

### Assistant
I have loaded the sales data and the data dictionary. The data dictionary clarifies the columns and some data issues:
- order_id: same order may appear more than once due to re-exports; keep one row per order_id.
- date: three formats occur, including ISO-8601 timestamps with UTC offsets.
- region: sales region with inconsistent spelling and capitalization.
- amount: order amount in USD; -999 means the amount is unknown (missing).

I will now:
- Normalize region names (trim spaces, lowercase to proper case).
- Parse dates into UTC datetime objects.
- Remove duplicate rows by order_id, keeping the first occurrence.
- Count missing amounts (-999).
- Calculate the required metrics:
  - north_q1_revenue and north_q1_orders for orders in North region in Q1 2024.
  - top_region by total amount.
  - missing_amount_orders count.
  - duplicate_rows_removed count.

I will proceed with the data processing and calculations.

### Assistant
The script failed because the 'pytz' module is not available in the environment. I will modify the script to use Python's built-in datetime timezone handling instead of pytz.

### Assistant
I cleaned the data by:
- Removing duplicate rows based on order_id, keeping the first occurrence (7 duplicates removed).
- Normalizing region names by trimming spaces and capitalizing.
- Parsing dates from multiple formats and converting them to UTC.
- Treating amount -999 as missing and excluding those from revenue calculations.
- Counting missing amount orders (8 orders).
- Calculating the sum of amounts and order counts for North region in Q1 2024.
- Identifying the top region by total amount (North).
